BobbleBubble 0.1
----------------

This is just a basic engine to see if anyone wants to
continue this work. Primarly, it was for this group of
developers: http://bubbob.sourceforge.net/

It uses the SDL library. Although it was only tested in a
GNU/Linux system, it should work fine in others unices
(FreeBSD, MacOSX...).

BobbleBubble 0.2
-----------

Tomble has incentivated me to release a new version,
so here it is. He sent the new enemies and a couple
of tiles graphics.
Alexander Kjï¿½l contributed with some code used by
the menu and pointed to some memory leaks.
There are a couple of other improvements that have
been asked by players.
Ingo Ruhnke contributed with the Tux graphics.

I am not maintaing this game (it was never my intention
to do so), so if you want to grab the code and do
something more with it, please contact me.
The code was done a couple of years ago and I was very
unexperienced and it is very visible by the use of arrays,
rather than the STL dynamic size vectors, and many other
stuff that go from the naming of variables and functions
to English mistakes (it ain't my native language).
I might be willing to make a re-code, if you are seriously
willing to develop it further.
