# TuxTox

This was a very incipient clone of bubble bobble, in case someone wants to have fun improving it.

It is written in C++/SDL.

Many people are aware of [Puzzle Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Bobble). That game uses the same characters of an older Arcade game called [Bubble Bobble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble), which was very different. And way more fun IMHO.

I was only a kid when I developed this.
